"""Bundle DayCent QA/QC outputs into the repo so they render on Streamlit Cloud.

Run this AFTER you have:
  1. regenerated the QA/QC outputs, and
  2. re-run the notebook's inventory-builder cell so qaqc_inventory.csv is fresh,
  3. copied that fresh qaqc_inventory.csv (with absolute /Users/... paths) into this folder.

What it does:
  - reads qaqc_inventory.csv
  - for every path column, copies the referenced file into assets/ (mirroring the
    site/check-folder structure) and rewrites the value to a relative assets/... path
  - removes the old assets/ first so deleted plots don't linger
  - leaves rows whose source file is missing pointing at a (non-existent) relative
    path, which the app shows gracefully as "not found"

Usage:
    python update_dashboard.py
